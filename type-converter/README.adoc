== Type converter - Camel Spring Boot Example

=== Abstract

This example shows two options creating a custom Type Converter with Apache Camel application using Spring Boot.

=== Introduction

Option 1 (Camel 2.x) - Converter added to the registry and loaded at the runtime : CustomConverterRuntimeTest and CustomRuntimeConverter.

Option 2 (Camel 3.x) - Converter source code generated during mvn package phase: CustomConverterGeneratedTest and CustomGeneratedConverter.
Required Camel Maven Package Plugin and build helper plugin - see pom.xml for details.

=== How to run

You can run example tests using

    mvn test

or in alternative, try to send own data through a rest service, performing a runtime convertion

   curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' --data-binary 'Chuck Norris 83' localhost:8080/api/convert
