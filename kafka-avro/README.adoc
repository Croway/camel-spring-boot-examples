== Camel Kafka example

=== Introduction

An example which shows how to use the link:https://avro.apache.org/docs/[Apache Avro] dataformat with Camel with the use of link:https://www.apicur.io/registry/[Apicurio Registry]

The application is configured to create the schema in apicurio registry if it doesn't exist. This schema is then used to serialize and deserialize the link:src/main/java/org/apache/camel/springboot/example/avro/Employee.java[Employee] instance from/to a kafka topic. A new Employee instance is periodically serialized into a configured topic by one camel route and consumed, deserialized and printed to the log by the second route.

See the link:src/main/resources/application.properties[configuration file] and the link:src/main/resources/avro/employee.avsc[schema definition] for more info.

== Trying out the example on your local machine

Start the apicurio registry in a docker container:

----
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 apicurio/apicurio-registry-mem:2.4.3.Final
----

Start the kafka broker:

----
docker run -d -e ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_LISTENER=yes -e KAFKA_CFG_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092 -e KAFKA_CFG_AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE=true -p 9092:9092 bitnami/kafka:latest
----

=== How to run the example

You can run this example using

    mvn spring-boot:run

You will see that each 5 seconds a new employee is created and received and printed to the application log:

----
New employee: {"firstName": "Buster", "lastName": "Upton", "hireDate": 1669040550701, "personal": {"phone": "1-628-816-1593", "address": "642 Crist Knolls"}}
New employee: {"firstName": "Genevie", "lastName": "Connelly", "hireDate": 1676979164176, "personal": {"phone": "111-242-0401", "address": "0423 Jared Junctions"}}
New employee: {"firstName": "Jefferson", "lastName": "Harber", "hireDate": 1659042443546, "personal": {"phone": "121.056.5072", "address": "8466 Tamisha Meadows"}}
New employee: {"firstName": "Wilburn", "lastName": "Lakin", "hireDate": 1666498121570, "personal": {"phone": "762.365.2778", "address": "9207 Schumm Point"}}
...
----

== Trying out the example on OpenShift

First, start with creating a new OpenShift project:

----
oc new-project csb-example-avro
----

Start a new deployment for the apicurio registry:

----
oc new-app apicurio/apicurio-registry-mem:2.4.3.Final
----

Deploy Kafka using OperatorHub:

----
oc process -f src/main/resources/openshift/kafka-template.yml -p STARTING_CSV=$(oc get packagemanifests strimzi-kafka-operator -o jsonpath='{.status.channels[?(@.name=="stable")].currentCSV}') | oc create -f -
----

=== How to run

The application is deployed using the `openshift-maven-plugin` that takes care of creating all the necessary OpenShift resources.

Simply use the following command to deploy the application:

----
mvn clean package -Popenshift
----

After the application pod reaches the `Ready` state you will see the expected output in the application's pod log.
