== Spring Boot Widget Gadget Example

=== Introduction

This example demonstrates the widget and gadget example from EIP book, running on Spring Boot.

The example with a similar setup (e.g. without Artemis) can be found in this illustration https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/eips/composed-message-processor.html[here]:

=== Configuration

Before the application can run, AtiveMQ Artemis Broker must be started. This can be done with docker, executing the following command:

[source,sh]
----
docker run --name artemis \
  -e AMQ_USER=admin \
  -e AMQ_PASSWORD=admin \
  -d -p 5672:5672 \
  quay.io/artemiscloud/activemq-artemis-broker
----

The port can be configured as desired, but do not forget to match the configured port number in your `application.properties`-file!

=== Build

After that, you can build this example using:

[source,sh]
----
$ cd spring-boot-widget-gadget
$ mvn package
----

=== Run

You can run this example with Maven using:

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

In the console you can observe the following log:

Moreover you can login to the Artemis console with the default username and password, admin/admin and check that there is one message in each of the following queues, widget.queue and gadget.queue

== Trying out the example on OpenShift

First, start with creating a new OpenShift project:

----
oc new-project csb-example-amqp
----

Start a new deployment for Artemis:

----
oc new-app quay.io/artemiscloud/activemq-artemis-broker -e AMQ_USER=admin -e AMQ_PASSWORD=admin
----

Patch the default `activemq-artemis-broker` service to serve the `5672` port:

----
oc patch service/activemq-artemis-broker -p '{"spec":{"ports":[{"name":"5672-tcp", "port": 5672, "protocol": "TCP", "targetPort": 5672}]}}'
----

And run the example with the openshift profile:

----
mvn clean package -Popenshift
----
