== Camel Kafka example

=== Introduction

An example which shows how to integrate Camel with Kafka offsetRepository(consumer) to use in order to locally store the offset of each partition of the topic

This project consists of the following examples:

  1. Producer triggers with a timer and produces messages to the configured topic partition
  2. Consumer consumes from configured topic by reading the offset value from locally stored file.

=== Preparing Kafka

This example requires that Kafka Server is up and running.

You can use the Camel CLI to start a Kafka broker:

    $ camel infra run kafka

=== Build

You will need to compile this example first:

    $ mvn compile

=== Run

Run the consumer first in separate shell 

    $ mvn spring-boot:run

camel-context.xml file has both kafka-producer and kafka-consumer routes defined to produce/consume messages to topic my-topic.

Press `Ctrl-C` to exit.

=== Configuration

You can configure the details in the file:
  `src/main/resources/application.properties`

You can enable verbose logging by adjusting the `src/main/resources/log4j2.properties`
  file as documented in the file.
