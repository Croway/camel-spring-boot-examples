== Camel Example Spring Boot and ActiveMQ AMQP

This example shows how to work with a simple Apache Camel application using Spring Boot and Apache ActiveMQ.

=== How to run the example

You need a running ActiveMQ broker. You can use the Camel CLI to start an Artemis broker:

    camel infra run artemis

You can run this example using

    mvn spring-boot:run

=== Using Camel components

Apache Camel provides 200+ components which you can use to integrate and route messages between many systems
and data formats. To use any of these Camel components, add the component as a dependency to your project.
